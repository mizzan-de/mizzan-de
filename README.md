### Thanks for visiting Mizzan's GitHub

We - the _mizzan_ team - are a group of a few engineers ib Berlin, who share the love for modern music and passion of microtonal harmonies. 
We got together to build the world's first digital microtonal piano 🎹. You can read more about our mission on our site, <https://mizzan.de>.
